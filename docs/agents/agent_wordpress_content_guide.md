# Agent Guide: Writing In-Depth Developer-Oriented WordPress Posts

## Purpose
This guide instructs agents to produce **long-form, detailed, engaging, and credible WordPress posts** suitable for a developer blog. Content should **showcase work, provide guides, walkthroughs, or demos**, and **highlight expertise** while avoiding sensitive or private information. The posts should be **user-oriented**, clear, structured, and SEO-friendly.

---

## 1. Tone and Style
- **Professional yet approachable**: speak to developers and tech enthusiasts.
- **Insightful and deep**: provide thorough explanations, technical context, and reasoning behind decisions.
- **Showcase expertise**: highlight problem-solving, development approaches, and best practices.
- **Engaging**: use examples, analogies, step-by-step walkthroughs, and visual references when possible.
- Avoid jargon without explanation; every technical term should have context or links.
- Write in **active voice**; first-person plural “we” is allowed for team experiences.

---

## 2. Structure Guidelines
Each post should generally follow this template:

### a) Title & Subtitle
- Clear, descriptive, and keyword-rich.
- Subtitle gives context or unique angle.
- Example:  
  **Title:** Building a Runtime-Configurable Vue + Spring Boot Portfolio  
  **Subtitle:** How to dynamically manage frontend/backend integration with Docker

### b) Introduction
- Hook the reader with the **problem or goal**.
- Explain the **value of the post** for the reader.
- Keep intro concise but engaging.

### c) Context & Background
- Provide background on the project or topic.
- Explain why the approach or solution was chosen.
- Include relevant **technical stack**, tools, and environment.

### d) Step-by-Step Guide / Walkthrough
- Break down development steps clearly.
- Include **code snippets, commands, or configurations**.
- Highlight **decisions, trade-offs, or alternatives**.
- Use numbered or bullet points for clarity.
- Emphasize **user benefit or learning**.

### e) Showcase / Demo
- Include **screenshots, diagrams, or outputs** if possible (mock data or sanitized).
- Highlight unique solutions, optimizations, or features.
- Show **realistic results** without exposing sensitive data.
- Include **links to relevant repositories, Docker images, or live demos** if available.

### f) Lessons Learned / Tips
- Discuss **pitfalls, workarounds, optimizations**.
- Include **performance considerations or best practices**.
- Keep advice actionable for readers.

### g) Conclusion / Next Steps

  - Use internal linking if referencing other posts or projects.  
  - Include descriptive image alt-text if images are used.
- **Readability**: Use headings, subheadings, code blocks, and bullet points.
- **Format**: **Author every post directly in HTML** (WordPress "Code Editor" / HTML mode). Use semantic tags such as `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<pre><code>` and `<blockquote>`. **Markdown is not permitted.**
- **Credibility**: Explain the “why” behind each technical decision.
- **Privacy & Security**: Never expose secrets, passwords, API keys, or sensitive internal data.
